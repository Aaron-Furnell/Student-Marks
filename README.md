This was a Python solution to the January 2021 Pearson BTEC Level 3 Nationals Extended Diploma done in College:

You are asked to use your software design, development, testing and evaluation skills to produce a program that meets the client’s requirements.

  A local school has commissioned you as a Junior Software Developer to write a program.
  
  The program should allow the teachers to record test results for students and display them in order from highest to lowest.
  
  You need to create a program that:
  
    • enables the teacher to enter the number of students in the class
    • allows the teacher to enter student name and test result for all students 
      • displays test results in order from highest mark to lowest mark along with the grade and student’s name
    • displays a message alerting the teacher if a distinction has been achieved
    • writes the test results to a text file.
    
  You must design, implement and test your program. You must also justify and evaluate 
  your decisions.
  
  When you are designing and developing the solution ensure that:
  
    • standard programming conventions have been followed
    • it is efficient and robust
    • it is user friendly
    • it provides accurate grade calculations
    • there is output to show:
     • test results in order from highest mark to lowest mark along with the grade and student’s name
     • if a distinction has been achieved and by which student.
   
  Information
  
    You should use the information in Figure 1 when you are designing and developing your program.
    
    Test score Grade
    
    Less than 40 Fail
    40 to 50 Pass
    51 to 69 Merit
    70 and over Distinction
    Maximum test score = 100
    
    Minimum number of students in a class = 6
